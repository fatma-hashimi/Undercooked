in notion notes for next two weeks

— add a button for -+10mins to move further

— OR recreate the -+ to be a bar that displays from 5 to 120 minutes like in my earlier concept art and then have the timer as is during runningPage

— draw animated assets for runningPage

— unsure if i can still create the collected data of previous cooked food. scoping problem and the fact that its a p5 sketch right now that refreshes and loses all history constantly

— *decide how to package the software* (ᵕ—ᴗ—) **DESKTOP APP!**
